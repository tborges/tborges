'''
Goal: Give the python code a location on my computer to look for #TODO.
If found, it copies/writes the line to a TODO.txt file.
Step 1: Write some python so I can give a specific location to look through.
Step 2: Loop through all the files/folders in that location.
Step 3: copy each line with a #TODO to a TODO.txt
